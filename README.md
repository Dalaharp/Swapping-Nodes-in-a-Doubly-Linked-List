# Swapping-Nodes-in-a-Doubly-Linked-List
Implements a doubly linked list with a "dummy" node at each end (head and tail) and provides a function that swaps a node with its next node by adjusting the pointers linking the nodes, without changing their data values. It also includes utility functions to create the linked list from an array, retrieve nodes by index, and print the list forwards and backwards.
